Replaying [#DaysGone](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DaysGone) on [#ps5](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ps5) in survivor 2 mode. Just experiencing this gorgeous story again, it’s dawned on me how criminal it is that we may never see a sequel. 😞😞😞. Although a new IP in the same world would be great, considering that Syphon Filter seems to be in that world😏
