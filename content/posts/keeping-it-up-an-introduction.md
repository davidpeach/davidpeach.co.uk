I was inspired by Jeremy Keith and his 100 words he has been publishing for the past 80 days. This is the same philosophy as The 100 days Project.I then heard the latest episode of Unfinished Business podcast where he, Jeffrey Zeldman and Andrew Clarke spoke about publishing on ones own site. Their conversation and views inspired me further.The discipline of doing something creative each and every day – no matter how quick or easy – sounded like something I’d like to try. To make myself create something every day and stop procrastinating. So this is it – my own approach to 100 words / 100 days. I will be writing an entry into this journal each and every day no matter how mundane it may be.I’m still thinking about whether or not to give myself some form of constaint. For example Jeremy’s daily journals have each been exactly 100 words. But I don’t want the thinking up of a constraint stop me from actually doing something, so I’ll just give it some thought.
