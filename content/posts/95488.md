I may be ready to take a break from metal music. Instead I’m going to try and soak up as music classical music as I can.

Starting tonight with Moonlight Sonata. Always reminds me of the original Resident Evil game. It’s the tune that Rebecca or Jill have to play on the piano to open a secret doorway.

They were the good old days. Keys in the shapes of card suits and attacks by terrifying hunters. 💚🧟‍♀️
