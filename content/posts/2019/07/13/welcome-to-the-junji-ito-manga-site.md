The Junji Ito Manga Site is my dedication to the works of acclaimed Horror Manga artist and writer, Junji Ito.

Ever since I read my first manga, [The Enigma of Amigara Fault](https://davidpeach.me/the-enigma-of-amigara-fault/), I was hooked on Junji Ito’s work. I couldn’t quite describe the feelings that his work gave me.

I was unsettled;

I was excited;

and I loved it.

After writing about his, and other artists’, works on my other website, the [Horror Manga Site](https://horror-manga.com), I have decided to focus in on just Ito’s work for now. Hence this new website.

## Early days

It is still early days and so the website itself still needs some work. However, it is working fine and all of my posts can now be read.

There are just some style tweaks I’d like to make.

## Future Plans

I will be looking to add reviews for all of Ito’s manga stories over the coming months, as well as the Anime and Films that have been based on his work.

I’d also like to share cool cosplays and fan art that I come across too, with full credit given to the creators of course.

I’m very excited about what the next year and beyond could bring with this site and would love for you all to join me on this journey.

## Thank You

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all of the people who have supported me throughout my writing on the Horror Manga Site. I appreciate each and every one of you and am looking forward to bringing you even more from here going forwards.

All the best to all of you,

Dave.
