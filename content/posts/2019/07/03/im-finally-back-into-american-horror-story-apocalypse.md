Micheal, eat your heart out

Once again, I have left the current series of American Horror Story until months after it has finished airing. I think it must be something inside me that doesn’t want to reach the end.

Last night I watched four episodes back to back — and I absolutely loved it. The old characters that have been making appearances have been so great. And the music, as always, is terrific.

Can’t wait to see how this series wraps up, and of course to begin 1984 in a few months time.
