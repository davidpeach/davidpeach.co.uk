I have just come across this awesome artwork by an artist called [Jack Batty](https://jackbattyart.tumblr.com). He has drawn a number of really cool [Junji Ito inspired pieces](https://jackbattyart.tumblr.com/tagged/junjiito), which I definitely think you should check out.

I really love his style. He even manages to make someone like Fuchi from [Fashion Model](https://davidpeach.me/fashion-model/) look… well… cute.

Enjoy!
