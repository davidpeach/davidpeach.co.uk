Initial thoughts

What a fucking incredible film. From start to finish I was gripped. Jennifer Connelly is great; Dario Argento is at the top of his game; and Donald Pleasance was a joy to watch as always.

The film was violent, creative and awe-inspiring in equal measure.

And that ending. That vile ending that just kept me second guessing myself until the credits rolled.

Thank you once again, Argento you crazy beautiful film maker.
