There’s a strange sense of joy and accomplishment that comes after mowing the lawns and thus filling the garden bin.

Knowing that you’ve cleaned the garden somewhat.

And knowing that you’re getting your money’s worth from the garden bin subscription.

Nothing worse than seeing that collection truck go past for another week and having nothing to meet them at the bottom of the drive with. Another few quid wasted (pro-rata).

But not this time. This time I’ll have an almost full bin and I won’t lie — feels pretty good.
