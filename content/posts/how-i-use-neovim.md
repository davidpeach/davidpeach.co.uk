I try to use Neovim for as much development-related work as possible.

This page serves as a point of reference for me, and other people interested, for what I use and how I use it.

Feedback is welcome and would love to know how you use Neovim too!

My complete Neovim configuration files can be found on [Github](https://github.com/davidpeach/.dotfiles/tree/main/nvim/.config/nvim).
