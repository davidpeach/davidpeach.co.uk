It is scientifically impossible to play this song _too_ loud.

I liked the darkness in the early 00s when their initial hits came out but then just forgot about them.

I have since rediscovered them.

This song, Bald, and the album it featured on: One way ticketâ€¦ are absolute fucking bangers.

10/10.
