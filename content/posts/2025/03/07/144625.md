My old boss, and someone I consider a friend — [Andy Hawthorne](http://andyhawthorne.uk), has recently started blogging. And the posts are coming in thick and fast.

Love his writing style and sense of humor that comes through the page.

> Life, photography and work…

Just wanted to share his website out.
