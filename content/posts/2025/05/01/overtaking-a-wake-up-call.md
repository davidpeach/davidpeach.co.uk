Yesterday I gave a family member a lift somewhere.

On the way there, entering a country road I began overtaking the car in front as I was struggling to get the person to their appointment on time.

The road ahead was clear and overtaking was permitted in this particular part of the stretch.

When all of a sudden a white Tesla — of all cars — came around a corner at the far end of the road I was overtaking on.

So i put my foot down as far as I could to finish the manoeuvre.

As I passed the car I was overtaking, the car In front was getting ever closer — not sure if they were speeding but being a Tesla I wouldn’t be too surprised.

I then pulled across as the on coming car flashed it’s lights twice at me “I’m here”. I flashed once back “sorry”.

Of course signalling with your lights is not encouraged and possibly illegal except under very specific circumstances.

Nevertheless we exchanged our vague highway morse code.

At the time it was obvious we weren’t going to impact.

But since then I’ve been stressing about the “What ifs”.

It’s even been running around my head about “What if the other driver reports me with dash camera footage, and I get prosecuted for dangerous driving”.

My mind automatically goes to the worst-case scenario.

Apparently if a letter isn’t received before 14 days has passed since an incident, then no action will be taken.

Thirteen days to go.

Hopefully I can look back on this post in a couple of weeks and laugh at myself.

Either way it gave me a wake up call to be extra mindful. And to not risk it all to save a potential few minutes. Because the trade off could be the rest of mine, and any passengers, days.

Stay safe out there.
