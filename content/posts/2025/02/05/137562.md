_In reply to [My weekend project](https://zeldman.com/2025/02/02/my-weekend-project-collage-music-standards-neurodiversity/) by L. Jeffrey Zeldman._

So many things I loved about this post!

Iâ€™ve used LastFM myself for years too, but never tried Pro. Will be giving it a try after reading this.

I got a bit obsessive over my own listening, and put a plugin together for myself to pull in my listening history, and ongoing listens, from LastFM. It saves them in my WP database so I can now have a URL per listen.

Dont judge me. haha.
