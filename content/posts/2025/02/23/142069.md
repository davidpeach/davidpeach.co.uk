I couldnâ€™t agree more. Excellent post thanks.

ive kept my own website for about 10 years now and itâ€™s gone through a bunch of migrations to different platforms / frameworks.

Settled on wordpress for now but have a laravel one Iâ€™ve built with wordpress importers ready to go. ðŸ¤£

kind of obsessed with my website.
