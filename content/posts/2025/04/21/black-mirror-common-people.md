Dark as fuck. And so brilliantly doing a send-up of the modern “subscription culture”.

Both leads were great.

This is the second thing I’ve seen Chris Dowd act in after The I.T. Crowd. So it was a complete departure for me.

And he is incredible in it.

Similarly with Rashida I’ve only seen her in The Office and Parks and Recreation.

She too was great.

They missed a trick in one scene though.

When they thought that his wife’s implant was malfunctioning and they headed to the Rivermind building. **They didn’t have Chris Dowd ask “Have you tried turning it off and on again”**.

This is the first time in recent memory I’ve needed to watch something light-hearted after seeing an episode of something.

A bleak, subscription-based nightmare.

And I loved it.
