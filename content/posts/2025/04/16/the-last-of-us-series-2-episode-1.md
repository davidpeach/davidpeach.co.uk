On the whole it was great to see the series back.

I’ve played through part 2, the game on which this series is based, five or six times through. So seeing certain scenes happen in this episode that were towards the end of the game was very strange for me.

But I get it from a storytelling perspective. Games are just completely different beasts to TV shows. Certain reveals and motivations need to be shown earlier.

Dina and Ellie at the Jackson New Years Dance

I just have to mention though. The Jackson dance scene was just incredible. I’m not 100% sure, but it seemed to be a shot for shot remake of the same scene from the game. And it hit just as well.

In fact, dare I say it hit slightly harder — mainly due to Joel seeming to have slightly more of a temper against Seth.

The shots, the dialogue, the chemistry between Dina and Ellie, and the music just fell right into place here.

Beautiful.

I’m looking forward to the rest of the series.

My prediction is that the series will end at the closing of the third day at the pinnacle theatre. It just seems like the most logical place for me for it to cliffhanger.

But who knows what changes they will make.
