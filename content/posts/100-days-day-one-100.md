Mid last year I heard about the idea of the 100 days project.

In a nutshell, you pick some form of creative pursuit — no matter how simple or complex — and commit to performing that action every day for 100 days.

I put the idea to some co workers. One person out of a few interested people actually completed it.

I failed in that challenge.

So I decided that I’m going to start again with an alternate take on Jeremy Keith’s 100 words for 100 days. My plan is to write 100 words the first day, 99 on the second, 98 the third etc.

This is the first.
