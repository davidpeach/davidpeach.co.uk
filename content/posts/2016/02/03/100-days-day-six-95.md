Missed yesterday’s entry by 50 minutes — been sat in the bath listening to this week’s episode of The Infinite Monkey Cage.

Finished The Last Of Us: Left Behind. Another great addition to the world and characters from the original game. Although the relationship between Ellie and Riley was doomed, it was still nice to see their friendship. It gave more depth to Ellie’s character too.

Cant wait to get on to Metal Gear Solid 5 next. Just need to power through 1-4 first. I don’t have to, but I’d like to experience the whole story.
