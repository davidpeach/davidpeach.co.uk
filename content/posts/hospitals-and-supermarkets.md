What do hospitals and supermarkets have in common?

Go on – take a moment to think about it.

Got it?

No? Well, I’ll tell you.

Both are places where absolute fucking plebs congregate right outside the front doors, smoking.

Smoking is an individual choice, regardless of how completely dumb it is, but Christ if I don’t wish they would bugger off 100 metres away.

And the complete hypocrisy of a hospital placing one of their smoking areas directly outside their cancer wards. \*smh\*

Walking through a cloud of nicotine fog is not something I want to be doing.

Go away smokers.

Go away.
