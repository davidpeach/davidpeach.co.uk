I just successfully submitted [my first test-driven package](https://github.com/davidpeach/laravel-hmac-validation-rule) to the PHP packagist repository. Itâ€™s just a little [Laravel validation rule object](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/validation#using-rule-objects) for validating a hmac hash against a configurable group of key / value pairs.

Am aiming to do a proper write up and possibly even a little video explaining it.
