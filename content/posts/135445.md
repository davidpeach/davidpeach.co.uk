this is actually scary. It’s mad how much the world’s business relies on these few us companies. Madness.

for everyday people it would be amazing if they made it super easy to self host things.

I use wordpress and would love to be able to reliably self host. I could get it working but doesnt feel like it would be taken well by hosting provider.
