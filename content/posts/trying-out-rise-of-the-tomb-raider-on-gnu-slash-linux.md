TLDR (Too long didn‚Äôt read) : It don‚Äôt work. üôÅ

Linux gaming, for me at least, has always presented problems. The initial issue is the fact that the selection of games is very slim compared with what is available on Windows computers. I was however greatly pleased this month when Rocket League was finally made available, and the smoothness is just as smooth as on Windows.¬†In fact the only reason I was still using Windows up until last week, was in order for me to play Rocket League. Pathetic, I know.

To get around the lack of the other games, I have attempted in the past to set up wine in order to install the Windows version of Steam. However with this I found that the quality of the graphics and FPS suffered greatly. So I just gave up a went back to using a Windows PC, which always made me feel dirty.

## Before Playing

Tonight I thought I would follow [a guide to installing PlayOnLinux](http://wiki.playonlinux.com/index.php/Installing_PlayOnLinux) word for word, and try out my favourite game at the moment, Rise of the Tomb Raider. PlayOnLinux is basically a front end interface over the top of Wine. Wine, I should probably mention, is a GNU/Linux program that allows Windows programs to be ran on a GNU/Linux system.

As I type this, I have just finished installing the Windows Steam using PlayOnLinux. I am now awaiting Rise of the Tomb Raider to finish downloading so I can try it out. I‚Äôm not expecting great results at all, but just to be able to play it would be good.

I have actually completed the story line of the game but love the world so much I want to finish all of the side quests and get 100% completion.

## Try to play it

It finished installing, I clicked play, and it game me an error. It says ‚ÄúFailed to start game (Invalid Platform)‚Äù, which is apparently down to a Direct X 11 issue.

Oh well, I guess it was never meant to be.
