Hellstar Remina is getting an official VIZ Media release! I canâ€™t explain how excited I am for this. I have read it previously online but will be so happy to be able to pay for an official copy and actually give back to Junji Ito for this insanely addictive story!

I wrote up my thoughts on [Hellstar Remina](https://davidpeach.me/hellstar-remina/) a while back too.

The cover art is absolutely beautiful too!
