I’m going to begin setting up my own “labs” area to play around with various web technologies.

For the longest time now I have been holding myself back quite a bit by only really learning technologies around current roles at the time and for my own personal site. This has mainly revolved around Laravel and to a lesser extent WordPress.

Whilst I will continue to love both of those projects, I do want to start pushing myself to learn things that are completely out of my comfort zone.

I will also begin writing more about my learning, discoveries and new things that excite me in web development — something I haven’t done for a long while.
