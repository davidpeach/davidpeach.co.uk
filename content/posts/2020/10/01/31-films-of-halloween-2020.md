I think I’m going to try and do the 31 days of Halloween by watching 1 new horror film each day in October. (Or just 31 new horror films by the month’s end is more likely for my timetable)

I may alter the order as I go.

-   1 — Suspiria (2018 remake) — _watched 1st October_
-   2 — [Friday the 13th part 2](https://davidpeach.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/06/thoughts-on-friday-the-13th-part-2/) — _watched 5th October_
-   3 — The People under the Stairs — _watched 6th October_
-   4 — Friday the 13th part 3
-   5 — Night of the Living Dead
-   6 — Jacob’s Ladder
-   7 — Hereditary
-   8 — The Blair Witch Project
-   9 — Sisters
-   10 — Blood and Black Lace
-   11 — Bay of Blood
-   12 — Don’t torture a duckling
-   13 — Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key
