I picked up Welcome to Hanwell for a few quid in a recent PlayStation Store sale. On first playing it has a good creep factor. Waking up in a morgue and taking your first steps in the dark, dank blood-splattered underground is a great introduction to any horror game.

The opening had me walking through a couple of corridors into the adjoining rooms and office, as it taught me the basic game controls and mechanics. One of these mechanics was looking behind you as you run ‚Äî this can only mean bad things ahead.

I love the atmosphere of the game so far ‚Äî despite having been unable to escape this basement area for about 45 minutes or so. The idea of an open-world horror game does tickle my fancy somewhat, so I really hope I can get past this first challenge.

And no ‚Äî I‚Äôm not going to spoil what that challenge is. üòÄ

Some bloody escape

## One draw back for me

I have to mention one thing that has me a bit miffed. I can not find any option to invert the Y axis. üôÅ . This may seem like a petty thing, but I find it super jaring to play any game without the inverted Y axis. I think this can only be due to the many many hours I spent playing Ace Combat 2 on the PlayStation as a youth.

I have tweeted the developers in the hope that it could perhaps get added in an update. Not sure if this will happen, but if you don‚Äôt ask you don‚Äôt get.
