[Droid Bishop](https://droidbishop.bandcamp.com/) is a well known and respected name within the synthwave scene. [He has music on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/droidbishop) that spans back several years, which you should definitely go and check out.

This month I was lucky enough to be able to send him some questions to answer and with Bishop-like precision, he got the answers straight back to me.

## The Interview

Please tell us about yourself in as many or as little words as you like.

<dd>I am Droid Bishop. I live &amp; make music in Los Angeles. This city at night is the best place and time to exist.</dd>

Growing up, who were your heroes in music?

<dd>My childhood musical heroes (who are still my heroes) include, Michael Jackson, Metallica, Queen, The Misfits, Daft Punk, Steely Dan, Pink Floyd, Django Reinhardt, Tupac, and many many more.</dd>

Growing up, who were your heroes outside of music?

<dd>Arnold Swarzenegger, Bruce Lee, Jamie Thomas, Harrison Ford, Marty McFly, Ferris Bueller , Zack Morris</dd>

What was the first album you remember buying?

<dd>Michael Jackson “Dangerous” on cassette</dd>

Was there any defining moment in your life when you knew that you wanted to write, record and perform music?

<dd>I’ve been playing music since I was 7 years old, but after discovering Metallica’s early albums I knew that was it for me.</dd>

Who is your biggest influence in how you approach what you do today?

<dd>Daft Punk, Tycho, Todd Terje, Power Glove, Com Truise, Aphex Twin</dd>

What is the proudest moment of your career so far?

<dd>Receiving messages from fan’s letting me know that my music makes their life better. That is what music/art should be about.</dd>

What is your favourite Book?

<dd>The Alchemist</dd>

What is your favourite Film?

<dd>Die Hard</dd>

What is your favourite TV Show?

<dd>Seinfeld</dd>

Do you have a favourite film/tv/musical soundtrack?

<dd>At the moment, “It Follows” film score. Also, “Back To The Future”</dd>

Are there any new albums you are binge listening to at the moment?

<dd>Not at the moment. I’m working on new music, so I tend to block everything else out while I’m in that process.</dd>

You’re walking somewhere and your mp3 player has only a little battery left; You’ve only got time for one more song. What song do you play?

<dd>Probably an unreleased demo of Droid Bishop song that i’m working on.</dd>

What advice would you give to your younger self?

<dd>Take it easy on the drugs &amp; alcohol.</dd>

If you could ask any person – living or passed – any question, who would it be and what would you ask them?

<dd>I would ask Freddie Mercury if we could make a song together.</dd>

Your stage name must be a reference to Bishop from Aliens. What made you use him for your name?

<dd>I had made a song many many years ago, titled ” Android Bishop” after the character from Aliens. I love that movie and so I just dropped the “A” for Droid and thought it would fit with my Sci Fi synth wave style.</dd>

Could you tell us a joke?

<dd>Knock Knock.<br>Who’s there?<br>…Go fuck ya self</dd>
