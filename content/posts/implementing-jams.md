Jams were a type of content popularized by the website [This is my jam](https://www.thisismyjam.com/).

This is my jam has since gone into read-only archive mode. This is such a great way of closing a website — especially one whose content is mostly community-created.

I started to use the site at the end of last year to start saving songs that stood out to me at a particular time.

Thanks to This is my jam for making me an [archive of my own](https://www.thisismyjam.com/davidpeach/songs). This means I haven’t lost all of my data with them just because they have closed doors.

I still love the idea of saving individual “jams” though, so I have implemented it on my own site as of today. I have also pulled my old jams into my site. Going forwards I look forward to documenting any new and/or forgotten gems that I hear in the future. They will all be found on my [Jams](https://davidpeach.me/category/jams/) page.
