> The drive to be constantly innovating to sell more new shit, when the shit we have works fine, is ruining technology.
> 
> I don’t want a new phone every year. I don’t want a new computer every six months. I don’t want a software upgrade that changes everything. I don’t want a fancy new language we have to rewrite everything in for reasons.
> 
> I want bug fixes. I want security patches. I want removal of fundamentally broken things. I want big thick manuals with full coverage of every option and setting and function call. I want people to be able to learn programming the way you learn woodworking – as a mature discipline not subject to regular world shaking innovation.

100% agree with this. No to the shiny shiny all the time.
