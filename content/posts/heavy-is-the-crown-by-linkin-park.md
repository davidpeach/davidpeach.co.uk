If [The Emptiness Machine](https://davidpeach.me/2024/09/10/linkin-park-the-emptiness-machine/) is a banger, which it is, then Heavy is the Crown is an ABSOLUTE FUCKING BANGER mate.

Wow.

This is really a new era of [Linkin Park](/tag/linkin-park) and I am here for it.

The song felt completely familiar of early Linkin Park, but completely fresh.

And Emilyâ€™s scream at 1 minute 48 seconds. Christ on a bike.

Wow.

Roll on the album release date. ðŸ¤˜

Love it.
