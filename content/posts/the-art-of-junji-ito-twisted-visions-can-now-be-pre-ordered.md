Junji Ito displaying his Art book

The upcoming book, The Art of Junji Ito: Twisted Visions, is now available for pre-order at the following places:

[Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1974713008/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=junjiitoman0b-21&creative=6738&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1974713008&linkId=2cab1b0b3089e8f3c7ce899f67360f58)

[Book Depository](https://www.bookdepository.com/Art-Junji-Ito-Junji-Ito/9781974713004)

[Waterstones](https://www.waterstones.com/book/viz-media-product/9781974713004)

It will be officially released on the **14th May 2020**.

From the picture above it looks like its a good size too — a little larger than A4 size I reckon. All the better to focus in on Junji Ito’s excellent craftsmanship and twisted imagery.

I’m looking forward to this one as it looks to contain many pieces of Junji Ito’s original artwork. Perhaps even some that were cut from some of his stories?
