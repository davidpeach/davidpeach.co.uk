Beautiful haunting song.

Gave me similar vibes to parts of the Inland Empire and Mulholland Drive soundtrack.

There is a very specific song that it’s reminding me of — I just can’t remember what song it is. <s>As soon as I remember I’ll update it here</s>.

I think it is reminding me of “Llorando” — the French version of Crying from Mulholland Drive.
