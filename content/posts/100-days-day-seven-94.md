Decided to Install Windows 7 back on to my P.C. as the primary operating system, then run GNU/Linux within virtualbox. Thought I’d give steam games on windows another go as I’ve got 8gb of ram sat there not really doing much. This way all my development stuff can be encapsulated within the virtual machine.

Also looks like I could be going to see Chas & Dave in a couple of months. I’d never heard much of their music until I started working at PM Connect. I gotta say they are growing on me.
