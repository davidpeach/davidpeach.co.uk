Gutted to hear that David Lynch has died.

Easily in my top three film directors. Possibly even the top spot.

Seeing Inland Empire in the cinema in 2006 (I think) completely blew me away. It still haunts me to this day. And turned me on to the music of Chrysta Bell.

Twin Peaks, Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway, Blue Velvet.

The guy was an immense talent.

Rest in peace Mr Lynch.

Crazy Clown Time.

The owls are not what they seem.
