From Wikipedia:

> Commonplace books (or commonplaces) are **a way to compile knowledge**, usually by writing information into books. They have been kept from antiquity, and were kept particularly during the Renaissance and in the nineteenth century. **Such books are essentially scrapbooks** filled with items of every kind: **recipes, quotes, letters, poems, tables of weights and measures, proverbs, prayers, legal formulas**. Commonplaces are used by readers, writers, students, and scholars as **an aid for remembering useful concepts or facts**. Each one is unique to its creatorâ€™s particular interests but they almost always include passages found in other texts, sometimes accompanied by the compilerâ€™s responses. They became significant in Early Modern Europe.

As soon as I heard about the idea of a commonplace I was immediately interested and wanted to start keeping one myself. But then I soon realised â€” my website is kind of on the way to becoming what I would call my own commonplace. I tend to write about a bunch of things that interest me, and had even begun saving quotes from the few books I read.

Not only will this give me a new angle at which to come at mt personal site from, I think it will even aid in ridding me of the occasional writerâ€™s block, whatever that is. If I start writing little and often â€” some personal notes and some posts â€” it can only do good things for my writing habits. ðŸ™‚
