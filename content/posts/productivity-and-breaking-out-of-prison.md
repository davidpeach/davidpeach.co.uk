More running tonight down the same canal route as Tuesday. I think I’m getting back into the swing of training again. Just need to start making a habit of getting back down the gym three evenings a week.

Been looking at productivity tools today too. I think i need to start organising my life in a structured way to actually get the things i want to get done, done.

Got to see the second episode of the new Prison Break series too. Some classic Scofield moments in there – it’s good to be back on the break train.
