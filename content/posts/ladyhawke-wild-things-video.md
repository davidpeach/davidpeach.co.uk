I can’t express how much Ladyhawke’s music has grown on me in the short month since I discovered her.

The song “Wild Things” was immediately one of my favourites from [her latest album of the same name](/2016/06/wild-things-by-ladyhawke/).

I have just seen the music video for this song and it has somehow made me love the song even more. Such a powerful song, and powerful delivery, make this one of my all time favourite songs I think.
