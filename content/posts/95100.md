I’ve been ignoring AI out of a sheer tiredness of hearing it from every corner of the web / tv / etc.

But damn it if it hasn’t been helpful in me making updates and new features to my website.

Due to not having much free time at the moment, or for the foreseeable future, it’s nigh on impossible to really sit and focus on learning something for extended periods of time.

But with using an AI assistant for the specific issues each step of the way, it’s helped both with getting it done, and my understanding it easier – especially when a lot of my personal coding is done whilst I’m cooking dinner of an evening.

My specific build has been a new plugin for my WordPress website; one that automatically imports my scrobbles from last fm – an itch I’ve been wanting to scratch for a long time.
