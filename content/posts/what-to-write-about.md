I’m having a great time keeping up to date with the blogging journey of a friend of mine.

And I mean keeping up — he must post at least three times a day.

And I have found it inspiring.

I used to write often back when I’d commute to work. But weirdly since working remotely I have written less. I suppose it’s not surprising — at home I have many things to pre-occupy myself.

But I want to start posting more often. Maybe not three times a day, but much more often than i do.

I do tend to post my daily [Wordle](/tag/wordle) plays, but I’m not counting those.

Who knows how this will go. Or even _if_ it will go.

Let us see.
