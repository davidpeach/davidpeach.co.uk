Most of modern tech, be it devices or software / digital services are corrupt and cancerous. They promise increased productivity and ease of use in exchange for your privacy and your control.

My aim is to go clear, as much as I can, and document that journey here.

Some things I have already done, such as switching to a privacy-respecting email provider like Protonmail. And a privacy-focused messaging service like Signal.

My aim for these posts is to give others a kind of guide to do this themselves. Some of the steps will be difficult for those who don’t have the privilege of time and / or technical know how. This is also part of the problem – some alternatives are not easy or convenient to switch to. But I will do my best here.
