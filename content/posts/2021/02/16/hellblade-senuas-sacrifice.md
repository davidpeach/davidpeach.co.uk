After seeing so many good things said about it, and seeing some many gorgeous photos taken in it, I finally started playing Hellblade.

My first impression is that this game is so thrilling to play, once the combat begins to open up.

There is a really interesting “perma-death” mechanic which, although I don’t fully understand the rules, does mean that I am super switched on at every moment of the game.

The world looks stunning. And the story development through finding stone tablets in the world is an interesting way to fill out that world’s history.
