Released in 2004, this is one of my favourite albums from my younger days.

Thanks to a work mate, my love for this band has been re-ignited. I have been listened to their albums lots over the past couple of weeks, but this one has stood out to me above most.

Possibly helped along from the nostalgia I feel for this album.

## Stand out songs for me

-   Track 2 — Gilded Cunt
-   Track 3 — Nemesis
-   Track 5 — Nymphetamine overdose
