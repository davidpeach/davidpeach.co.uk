Day out taking Henners to the park. He loved it and didn’t want to leave.

I need to get fit enough to run this area in the early mornings.

Here’s a picture of a swan we fed peas to.

[![A white swan stands on the small shore of a lake - the lake in the background. The swan is eating frozen peas off the floor.  It is sunny and only the faint remnants of light clouds are in the sky. The foliage and small trees on the shore line have no leaves yet. Just off shore a small stone structure can be seen. ](/assets/PXL_20250309_135103644-2048x11-xCxSV1IVw1qc.jpg)](/assets/PXL_20250309_135103644-2048x11-xCxSV1IVw1qc.jpg)
