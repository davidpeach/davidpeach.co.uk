I really enjoy building scripts for my own workflow.

I wish I had the skills to build things in the real world, but until then I’ll keep building stuff in the digital space only.

Although I love working with PHP and Laravel, it is Bash that has re-ignited a passion in me to just build stuff without thinking its got to work towards being some kind of “profitable” side project.

Don’t. Stop. Building.
