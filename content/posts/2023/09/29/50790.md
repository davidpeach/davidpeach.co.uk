I’m now running pi-hole through my Raspberry Pi 2b.

It’s both amazing and depressing just how many trackers are being blocked by it. I even noticed a regular ping being made to an Amazon endpoint exactly every 10 minutes.

I will try and write up my set up soon, which is a mix of setting up the Raspberry Pi and configuring my home router.

I’ve also managed to finally get a home server running again – using Ubuntu Server LTS.

My plan on my server is to just install services I want to self-host using docker. Docker being the only program I’ve installed on the machine itself.

So far I have installed the following:

-   Home Assistant — On initial playing with this I have decided that it’s incredible. Connected to my LG TV and lets me control it from the app / laptop.
-   Portainer — A graphical way to interact with my docker containers on the server.
