I’ve loved Otep’s music since discovering the album “Sevas Tra” — with that insane album cover being the thing that brought me in.

Earlier today (yesterday) I listened to the recently-released **The God Slayer**, made up of half original songs and half covers.

Loved it, although Sevas Tra has been — and remains — my favourite of Otep’s.

My favourite songs from my first listen of the album are definitely the covers of Eminem’s “The way I Am” and the Beach Boys’ “California Girls”.
