By trade I am a PHP developer. I’ve never done devops in a professional setting. However, for a while I have had a strange fascination with various continuous integration and deployment strategies I’ve seen at many of my places of work.

I’ve seen some very complicated setups over the years, which has created a mental block for me to really dig in and understand setting up integration and deployment workflows.

But in my current role at Geomiq, I had the opportunity of being shown a possible setup — specifically using Kubernetes. And that was sort of a gateway drug, which finally led me to getting a working workflow up and running.

I now want to start sharing what I have learnt and build out a fully-fledged deployment workflow. Not sure how many posts it will take, or what structure it will take, but my aim is to make devops and CI/CD as approachable as possible.
