This week I am excited to share an interview I did with one of my favourite lady performers at the moment – [Roslyn Moore](http://www.roslynmoore.com/). You should be listening to her music, specifically her awesome album, “[Hazy (A Desert Opera)](https://soundcloud.com/roslyn-moore/sets/hazy-a-desert-opera)“. [I wrote a review of the album](/2016/09/27/hazy-a-desert-opera-by-roslyn-moore/) recently and can’t recommend it enough.

Roslyn is part of a genre of music known as “Sadcore” and works often with another favourite of mine, “[Scarlett Taylor](http://www.scarletttaylor.com/)” who [I interviewed last month](/2016/09/09/interview-scarlett-taylor/).

Without further ado let’s chat with Roslyn Moore.

## The Interview

Please tell us about yourself in as many or as little words as you like.

<dd>I’m a bit out there. The more people I come in contact with, the more I realise how differently I seem to view the world than the average person.</dd>

Growing up, who were your heroes in music?

<dd>I don’t have a specific name to give. Everyone in music was inspiring to me. I always admired anyone who was able to express themselves openly through music. It’s not an easy thing to put yourself out there and be exposed in that way.</dd>

Growing up, who were your heroes outside of music?

<dd>Because I always felt so unsure of myself, I really admired people who were just the opposite. People who are unapologetically themselves. So many people live their lives based on what other people perceive of them.</dd>

Was there any defining moment in your life when you knew that you wanted to write, record and perform music?

<dd>I can’t say there was one defining moment. I’ve always been drawn towards music and wanting to make music, but I was always kind of shy about singing and putting myself out there. I never felt I was good enough. As time went on I just stopped caring as much about how I may come across to other people, and started living for myself. I never really had much of a desire to actually get out there and perform, but now that I’ve been able to create music I feel connected with, I’m much more excited to get out there and bring it to life!</dd>

Where do you get your creative energy from?

<dd>I draw a lot from my personal experiences and how I view the world. I also get a lot of inspiration from films I like.</dd>

What is the proudest moment of your career so far?

<dd>Performing at the Whiskey a Go-Go in Hollywood, CA and seeing my name on Hollywood Blvd. It was so cool.</dd>

What is your favourite Book?

<dd>Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn</dd>

What is your favourite Album?

<dd>This is such a hard one to answer! I can’t say I have one overall all time favorite album, but rather I go through different phases where I will binge listen to one album and it will be my favorite for that period of time and then I’ll move on from it.</dd>

What is your favourite Film?

<dd>Another hard one to answer! I love film nearly as much (if not as much) as I do music! So it’s hard to pick one favorite, but I really love Quentin Tarantino’s films. I’d say in general his are my favorite. But I have many favorites!</dd>

What is your favourite TV Show?

<dd>I don’t want a lot of TV and when I do it’s usually just on Netflix. I’ll watch as much as I can of one show and then move on to the next. I just finished Breaking Bad and I’m now finishing up Narcos. Really love both!</dd>

Do you have a favourite film/tv/musical soundtrack?

<dd>I can’t say I have a favorite soundtrack, but I do really love and enjoy music in film and television. It has such a large effect on the overall feel of the moment and adds so so much. I can’t wait to have my music accompany film or tv like that.</dd>

Are there any new albums you are binge listening to at the moment?

<dd>Lately I’ve been binging on Skeleton Tree by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. I’m loving it. It was the perfect soundtrack to my recent trip to California.</dd>

You’re walking somewhere and your mp3 player has only a little battery left; You’ve only got time for one more song. What song do you play?

<dd>Asking all the hard questions! It would probably depend on the day, but off the top of my head I would pick Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd</dd>

What advice would you give to your younger self?

<dd>You are good enough to follow your dreams. Don’t put them off.</dd>

## A Big Thank you

Thank you so much to Roslyn for taking the time to answer those questions. I always love to learn more about the person behind the music and Roslyn did not disappoint. At the time I contacted her she was actually mid-way into her tour, so I appreciate her fitting this interview into her schedule.

Take a listen to [Roslyn’s music over on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/roslyn-moore) right this instant. That’s an order.
