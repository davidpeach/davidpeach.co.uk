title: The Tsunami in the fridge

This morning I opened the fridge door to be greeted by a slight splash of water.

Okay — not quite a tsunami — but that’s clickbait for you.

Underneath the veg drawer of our modest 500mm wide fridge freezer lies a small pool of water in the recesses of its base.

First thought of course is “Ah great. Amazing. The fridge is buggered. One of the stalwarts of the modern home… packed in.”

But no.

The fridge is fine.

Upon lifting the vegetable drawer out I notice a block of ice on the back edge of the fridge base.

What I’m assuming is that the temperature drops to freezing to create this block over time, then as the fridge goes through some kind of cycle where it’s not quite freezing, it melts a bit.

I should do something about the temperature but I’m yet to find the dial.

If I should find it surely I should fix the issue with a simple nudge in the direction of non-freezing.

If I was loaded I could trash the old fridge and get a brand spanking new one.

But then… That would be cold…
