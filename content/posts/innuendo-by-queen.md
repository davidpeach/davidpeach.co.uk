This album has resurfaced in my life and it just hits a lot differently than it did last time I heard it.

Every song is an absolute banger that are bookended by two of my favorite Queen songs â€” Innuendo and The Show must go on.

The lyrics of These are the days of our lives is especially poignant to me now as a father.
