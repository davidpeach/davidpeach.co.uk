Watching The people under the stairs

An image from an old film haunted me for some years in my childhood. Only recently did I discover somehow, without watching it, that the image was from The people under the stairs.

Now Iâ€™m going back in to a film I may have seen as a child and possibly blocked out, out of trauma.

This film was amazing. I need to write up some thoughts on it soon.
