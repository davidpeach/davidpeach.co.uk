How does this Orwellian bill affect a single person website that federates on fediverse?

For example, my website is WordPress self-hosted, only I post on it, but I federate with the Activitypub plugin.

Does that mean I have to watch what I say less I get in trouble if I get federated somewhere where I get in trouble, or do I stop federating all together?

The bill is written on the UK government website under “Science and innovation section”, but this is anything but innovation.
