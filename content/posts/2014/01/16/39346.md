I have recently been introduced to the wonderful world of Japanese Manga by some friends at work. I hear mentioned things such as a school with Freddie Mercury as a pupil, humans who turn into cars and people becoming obsessed and consumed by spirals. But the story that set me on the path of reading manga was [The Enigma of Amigara Fault](https://davidpeach.me/2018/03/20/the-enigma-of-amigara-fault/) â€“ a haunting Lovecraft-esque story written by Junji Ito.
