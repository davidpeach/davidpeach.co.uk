The more I see how JavaScript gets used in websites I visit, the more I despair. Like when extra content gets loaded in, I click a link in that extra content to go to another page – so far, fine. But then if I click the back button in browser it won’t jump to where I was previously because that content isn’t there any more – not until I scroll down or click the ‘load more’ link at least. I dare say there is a responsible way to approach this. Here’s my idea – just paginate the results and provide page links. Zany idea I know.
