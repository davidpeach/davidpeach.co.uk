Iâ€™m really impressed with Mirrors the Sky album by [Lyla Foy](https://www.lylafoy.co.uk/) ([@lylafoy](https://twitter.com/lylafoy) on Twitter).

First moments of that album, and a couple of songs further in, her voice sounds like an early Stevie Nicks.

Listened twice this evening and may go for a third.
