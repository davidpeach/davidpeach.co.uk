In four days time, I’ll be doing the Birmingham half marathon along with a mate from work.

The gravity of what I have said I’ll do didn’t really hit me until earlier today, when we were looking over the route map and elevation.

13.1 miles it is and I know I’m going to feel every step. I’m both nervous and excited in equal measure.

I’m now starting to wish I had prepared more. The longest run I’ve done — at a steady pace — has been about 8 miles or so and since paintballing last weekend has given me achy muscles, I’ve had no option but to rest up.

I’m quietly confident that the cheering of the crowds and general good feelings of all involved will help me — and indeed everybody else — to make it through the race.

I just hope I have prepared enough.
