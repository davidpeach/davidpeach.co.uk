I commute into Birmingham each day to work and see people on there phones and tablets passing the time.

I’m a bit of a nosy git, so I can’t help but take a glance at what they’re looking at.

I’m always disheartened when I see — most of the time — it ends up being Facebook.

It is sad to see that a lot of people’s only experience of the web is through the guarded corridor that is Facebook.
