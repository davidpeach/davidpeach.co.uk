Life is Strange Before the Storm re-acquainted us with some of the characters we had come to love from the original game. But not only that, we got introduced to some new characters also. A favourite of a lot of peoples, myself included, was Steph Gingrich. She’s the girl who you really need to take the time and play D&D with in [episode 1](https://davidpeach.me/2017/09/life-strange-storm-episode-1/).

Steph is played brilliantly by the talented, and always-funny, Katy Bentz. Katy has been building up quite the following, which includes too [her growing YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9oHch6tjkeKfOVzd8xSww). Every video she makes is a joy to watch. I was blessed to be able to send Katy some questions – a lot of the same questions that I also asked in my recent [Interview with Kylie Brown](https://davidpeach.me/2017/12/interview-with-kylie-brown-rachel-amber-in-life-is-strange-before-the-storm/) – that she very quickly replied back with.

## The Interview

Please tell us about yourself in as many or as little words as you like.

<dd>I am an actor living in Los Angeles, California. Just passed my year mark of living in the city of hustle! I’m outgoing, independent, determined, strong-willed, caring, and passionate. I enjoy to find the simple things in life, as silly as that may sound. We can get so caught up in our day-to-day life that we forget about walks around the block, or watching the sunset. My favorite color is blue and I love Dolphins! ?</dd>

What is your favourite Book?

<dd>Not much of a reader, but I read White Oleander for one act in high school and I really enjoyed it. I do love to read self helps books though!</dd>

What is your favourite Album?

<dd>Omg! Too many. Probably a Say Anything Album. I love anything pop punk!</dd>

What is your favourite Film?

<dd>(500) Days of Summer anyone? ?</dd>

What is your favourite TV Show?

<dd>I really like That 70’s Show. The 100 and Under the Dome are some others I have really enjoyed.</dd>

Do you have a favourite film/tv/musical soundtrack?

<dd>Guardians of the Galaxy is awesome! But also The Legally Blonde Musical Soundtrack….I know I am all over the place!</dd>

What poster / posters do you remember having on your walls growing up?

<dd>I had way too many animal posters haha and these two weird ocean space posters…I know…interesting. Oh! And a Backstreet Boys poster where I circled Nick’s face and drew on the other members haha</dd>

You’re walking somewhere and your mp3 player has only a little battery left; You’ve only got time for one more song. What song do you play?

<dd>Oh man. Too many options. I get on song kicks, where I find songs and listen to them over and over until I can’t anymore haha, so I would say out of my current mix…Touch by Little Mix, such a feel good song!</dd>

Was there any defining moment in your life when you knew that you wanted to be an actor and model?

<dd>In High School when I was still finding my place amid being a teenager, I quit the dance team and joined the drama club and I’m not sure that that was when I knew I wanted to be an actor. But that was the moment where I felt like I could finally be myself and that my peers weren’t going to judge me. And that was the start of my passion for the arts and everything it stood for.</dd>

What is the proudest moment of your career so far?

<dd>Life is Strange: Before the Storm, hands down. I have never felt so amazing about a certain role and I get to see the affect this game and my character have on the players and it’s the greatest feeling.</dd>

What advice would you give to your younger self?

<dd>Works harder than you think you need to work.</dd>

Growing up, who were your heroes?

<dd>My mom and my peers around me. I never looked very far for influences in my life. My mom meant and still means a lot to me and I always look to her for guidance. One of my best friends in high school was two years older than me and in the drama club. She was someone I strived to be like. She is still my best friend to this day and someone I am riding this journey with, and it’s amazing.</dd>

Who is your biggest influence in how you approach what you do today?

<dd>My mom again haha and past and current relationships. I feel like the people I am closest with are the ones that see all of me and because they are close to me, they can be honest with me about things that I may need to do differently.</dd>

If you could ask any person – living or passed – any question, who would it be and what would you ask them?

<dd>Honestly, any elder person. And I would want to ask them what advice they’d give their 25 year old self.</dd>

In Chloe Price’s journal she writes: “I can never decide if Steph is the coolest or nerdiest person in all of Blackwell.”. What would you say to that? Coolest or Nerdiest?

<dd>Coolest!</dd>

With Steph being a new character in the already established world of Arcadia Bay, did you feel any pressure in stepping into that world for the first time?

<dd>Not at all! I didn’t know the story line prior to recording for Steph, so I came in with a fresh mind, ready to bring the character to life.</dd>

Are there any causes / projects that you would like to raise an awareness of to the readers here?

<dd>There aren’t specific projects or organizations off the top of my head, but I am a big supporter of anti-bullying projects and efforts. Bullying was a huge thing when I was growing up and I can only imagine what kids in schools are going through now.</dd>

Could you tell us a joke?

<dd>What’s a plumber’s favorite drug? Crack! I just made that up! Pretty good? haha</dd>
