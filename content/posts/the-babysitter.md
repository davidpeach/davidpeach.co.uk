Not to be confused with the 1995 erotic, straight-to-video film starring Alicia Silverstone. 2017â€™s The Babysitter is a violent, fun watch and completely ridiculous in all the right places.

I was recommended this by a friend and did really enjoy it. I was surprised that it was a 15 though.

Looking forward to watching the sequel some time soon.
