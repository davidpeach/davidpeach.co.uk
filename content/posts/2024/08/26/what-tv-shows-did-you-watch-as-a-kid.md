> What TV shows did you watch as a kid?

I vaguely remember watching Teddy Ruxpin, He-Man and Thundercats as a very young child.

Pretty standard 80s child I guess.

I got into [the X Files](/tag/the-x-files) and [Buffy](/tag/buffy-the-vampire-slayer) in the 90s when I was in high school. I was obsessed with both.

I think the one constant from a child till now though — with a few breaks between — is actually Neighbours.
