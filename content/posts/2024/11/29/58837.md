Started playing Horizon Zero Dawn remastered this morning before work.

I played the original for a couple hundred hours at this point. One of my favorite games.

Decided not to import my game data to this remastered version so I can start again fresh.

Also I‚Äôve gone for the hardest difficulty straight off.

Take no prisoners. üèπ
