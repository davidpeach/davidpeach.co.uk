Hey [@ChrisWere](https://toot.wales/@ChrisWere) 👋. I’m using the WordPress friends plugin to subscribe to people on fedi.

For some reason my activitypub feed for you disappeared and so had to re-add you.

I’m only saying in case it shows on your side as “unfollowed” then “followed” in succession and you thought “what’s this joker up to?”. 😅
