> What aspects of your cultural heritage are you most proud of or interested in?

I have an interest in the history of Britain.

It’s not something I actively pursue at the moment though.

I started listening to the [British History Podcast](/tag/british-history-podcast/), which was very interesting and entertaining to listen to.

Writing this based on today’s prompt has reminded me of that interest and so may pick up my learning once again.
