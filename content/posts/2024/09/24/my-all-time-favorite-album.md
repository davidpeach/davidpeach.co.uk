> What’s your all-time favorite album?

The Bends by Radiohead

This is one writing prompt that has taken me a while to really think about.

There’s a bunch of albums I could name that are in my top albums. However, trying to name a single all-time favorite album has been tricky.

I decided in the end on “The Bends” by Radiohead.

I love every single song on the album and each song flows perfectly into the next.

## Stand out songs

Every song is a banger. But singling out a few I’d say these are my favorite off the album:

-   Just
-   My Iron Lung
-   Bones (used excellently in the TV series Derek)

So glad I got to see these live at V Festival back in 2006.

That was a while ago now.

So much has changed since then.

In fact, now I come to think about it, this album is one where I can remember specific times when I’ve lay there, often in the dark, and just listened to it through with headphones.

It’s amazing what you remember when you sit to write something down.
