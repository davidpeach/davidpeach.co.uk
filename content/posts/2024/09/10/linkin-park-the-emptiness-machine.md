Really digging the new Linkin Park song “The Emptiness Machine”.

And the new members are a welcome addition.

Emily fits really well in my opinion and her vocals on this song make me excited for Linkin Park’s future.

Yes, Chester is missed greatly, and I can’t imagine the pressure of taking his spot, but she’s doing great.

On their Livestream, a couple of the old songs were a little jarring for me. But only because it’s a new person singing them.

On the whole she brought something both reminiscent and fresh to the songs I have grown up loving.

If people hate the idea of lineup changes then tell them to check out Fleetwood Mac – they’ll lose their heads.
