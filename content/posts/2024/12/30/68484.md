Even though the WordPress ecosystem is about as stable as the dimensions in Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart right now, I do still self host my website on it.

I’ve been working on a lastfm scrobbles importer with time permitting over the past month.

Its currently in Alpha testing and is importing both the older scrobbles from the past ten years up to currently listening to.

It’ll be nice to be able to have the option to scrobble directly to my site in the future. Until now this will do me.

I will release it in Beta as soon as the admin area pages are tidied up.
